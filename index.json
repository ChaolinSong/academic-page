Thus, it is crucial to accurately assess the structural reliability and perform reasonable management actions. Simulation methods can yield more accurate reliability analysis results compared with approximation methods. However, as structures and infrastructure systems become complex, evaluating the engineering models can be very time-consuming. To address the gap, this paper proposes an active learning Kriging-assisted method for efficient structural reliability analysis. The proposed method consists of two stages. In the first stage, Kriging-based random walk, i.e., MCMC, is performed to explore the failure domain. Then, in the second stage, a Gaussian mixture distribution is established as the quasi-optimal sampling distribution for importance sampling. With the active learning framework that enlarges the training database in the MCMC and importance sampling process, the proposed method can achieve robust exploration of the whole failure domain, and also accurate failure probability estimates. Two classical numerical examples first validate the performance and advantages of the proposed method for handling problems with multiple failure domains and rare events. Then, a real-world application demonstrates the feasibility of applying the proposed method for quantitatively assessing the failure risk for prestressed-concrete continuous rigid-frame bridges during the service life.","tags":[],"title":"Paper Published: An efficient structural reliability analysis method with active learning Kriging-assisted robust adaptive importance sampling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rucheng Xiao"],"categories":[],"content":"Prof. Xiao was invited to give a keynote speech at the Second World Conference on Long Span Arch Bridge Construction Technology held from March 19 – 21 in Nanning, GuangXi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China.\nThe presentation was titled \u0026ldquo;Past and Present of Arch Bridges — Also Discussing Innovations of Arch Bridges\u0026rdquo;. From the Corbel arch over 4000 years ago to the stone arch bridge of the Mycenaean Civilization, from the ancient arch bridge of the Rome period to the Bayonne Bridge, the brilliance of the arch bridge in the past is shown.

As a highly redundant structure, the structural performance of a cable-stayed bridge can be significantly influenced by the cable prestressing forces. Therefore, the determination of optimal cable forces is necessary at the design stage. As computational mechanics matures, numerical computational methods such as high-fidelity finite element analyses facilitate accurate assessment of the bridge state, and evolutionary algorithms have been applied to enhance the global search ability. However, the combination of evolutionary algorithms and finite element model-based evaluations can substantially increase the computational burden, rendering the efficiency of optimization significantly time-consuming for practical engineering projects. To overcome this limitation, this work proposes a new surrogate model-assisted differential evolution method to facilitate the determination of optimal cable forces. Different from the existing methods, the proposed method develops a new individual selection strategy together with an additional archive to manage the diversity of population and further enhance the exploration ability. A new criterion is also proposed for the refinement of the surrogate model in the local search stage to avoid redundant information. Furthermore, B-Spline interpolation curve is integrated within the framework as a high-dimensional model representation technique for the design variables of cable forces. Five classic numerical examples and a practical engineering application validate the performance and advantages of the proposed method.","tags":[],"title":"Paper Published: Cable force optimization of cable-stayed bridges: A surrogate model-assisted differential evolution method combined with B-Spline interpolation curves","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rucheng Xiao","Chaolin Song","Bin Sun"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1675209600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675209600,"objectID":"afcc5de173eb2ce467b5a39f64fc3ba8","permalink":"https://www.tjlongspanbridge.com/publication/2023structures1/","publishdate":"2023-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023structures1/","section":"publication","summary":"The main cables of suspension bridges typically serve as the primary load-carrying components. Determination of reasonable main cable sizes is crucial for the bridge safety and functionality. The limit state design method with the combination of partial factors has been widely used in multiple countries as a substitute for the factor of safety design method. Determination of reasonable partial factors that can properly satisfy a target reliability index has received much attention. However, most of the existing research neglects the secondary stress effect, which can be of a significant magnitude, for the main cable. To address the gap, this paper proposes a reliability-assisted framework for the determination of the partial factors considering both first and secondary stresses for the main cable design. Three suspension bridges with main span lengths ranging from 850 m to 2300 m are used as the engineering background. Results show that the recommended design factors can be used in the preliminary design stage to facilitate a reasonable cable design that yields the target reliability index, therefore validating the feasibility of the proposed framework.","tags":[],"title":"Paper Published: Reliability-assisted determination of partial factors for the design of main cables considering secondary stress effect","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chaolin Song","Rucheng Xiao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1651363200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651363200,"objectID":"477da95ed2e0443063ea9d9c8ee02f3a","permalink":"https://www.tjlongspanbridge.com/publication/2022jse1/","publishdate":"2022-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022jse1/","section":"publication","summary":"Adaptive reliability analysis methods based on surrogate models, especially kriging, have been successfully implemented in many problems. However, the application of kriging is limited to low-dimensional problems with noncategorical performance data. Support vector machine (SVM), by contrast, addresses these limitations, but its application in reliability analysis faces several challenges with regard to robustness, accuracy, and efficiency. This study proposed a new adaptive approach based on probabilistic support vector machine for reliability analysis (PSVM-RA). Different from existing methods that only select training points in the margin of the SVM, the proposed method adopts a new learning function that considers the wrong classification probability for each realization and maximizes the potential for new information offered by a candidate sample for the training set. Moreover, the upper bound of the error that is introduced by the SVM in estimating the failure probability is derived based on a Poisson binomial distribution model considering the likelihood of wrong classification for all the points in the margin of the SVM. This upper bound of error was used in the proposed framework as a stopping criterion to guarantee the desired accuracy. Three numerical examples and an engineering application regarding the wind-reliability analysis of transmission towers were investigated to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. It was demonstrated that PSVM-RA can provide robust estimates of failure probability when other state-of-the-art methods fail. Moreover, it offers a balance between efficiency and accuracy.","tags":[],"title":"Paper Published: High-Dimensional Reliability Analysis with Error-Guided Active-Learning Probabilistic Support Vector Machine: Application to Wind-Reliability Analysis of Transmission Towers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chaolin Song","Rucheng Xiao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1646092800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646092800,"objectID":"be7cc2dab950b51608e99e5c8b07eccb","permalink":"https://www.tjlongspanbridge.com/publication/2022cmame1/","publishdate":"2022-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022cmame1/","section":"publication","summary":"Bayesian updating provides a sound mathematical framework for probabilistic calibration as new information emerges. Bayesian Updating with Structural reliability methods (BUS) reformulates the acceptance domain in rejection sampling as a failure domain in reliability analysis, offering considerable potential for higher efficiency and accuracy. Kriging-based Monte Carlo Simulation has been studied to facilitate the application of BUS for problems with expensive-to-evaluate likelihood functions. Nevertheless, as the implementation of BUS often involves a rare event, the number of required Monte Carlo samples can become unaffordable. This gap is addressed here through Bayesian Updating with Active learning Kriging-based Adaptive Importance Sampling (BUAK-AIS). An importance sampling density based on Gaussian mixture distribution is introduced, and the discrepancy between the adopted and theoretically best sampling densities is measured through the Kullback–Leibler cross entropy. The proposed method includes an active learning framework that adaptively extends the training set and optimizes the parameters of the Gaussian mixture distribution based on the cross entropy and the current Kriging model. As BUS uses accepted samples to estimate the posterior distribution, the present work discusses the estimate for the first moment of the posterior distribution, and proposes a criterion to check the sufficiency of the number of accepted samples to guarantee robust estimations. A new stopping criterion is also developed by quantifying the error introduced by Kriging. Three numerical examples and an engineering application concerning model updating of cable-stayed bridges in the construction process are investigated, demonstrating the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method.","tags":[],"title":"Paper Published: BUAK-AIS: Efficient Bayesian Updating with Active learning Kriging-based Adaptive Importance Sampling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chaolin Song","Rucheng Xiao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"1126308751fdb6aa6b660768208f1bd6","permalink":"https://www.tjlongspanbridge.com/publication/2022ress1/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022ress1/","section":"publication","summary":"Optimal management of systems over their service life as they face a multitude of uncertainties remains a significant challenge. While additional information can reduce uncertainties, collecting new information incurs cost and may include observation error. Value of Information (VoI) analysis facilitates quantitative assessment of the expected net benefits of collecting new information. Moreover, partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) can be integrated within VoI analysis to efficiently capture the sequential decision-making environments for systems. The assumption of stationary environment in existing POMDP frameworks for VoI analysis may not be valid, however, in many applications such as deterioration processes which are often non-stationary. To address this gap, this paper presents a new approach called VoI-R-POMDP. A new POMDP framework is proposed to accurately describe non-stationary processes using multiple integrated transition models. New strategies based on reliability concepts are developed to accurately and efficiently determine the parameters of the proposed POMDP model based on prior information. A new formulation of the observation function based on Bayes’ theorem is also derived. The proposed framework is applied to a corroding beam example. Results indicate that VoI-R-POMDP can accurately and efficiently describe the deterioration process and thus provide accurate VoI estimates for non-stationary systems.","tags":[],"title":"Paper Published: Value of information analysis in non-stationary stochastic decision environments: A reliability-assisted POMDP approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chaolin Song","Rucheng Xiao","Bin Sun"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"86257ee62ae0d10151194b2128c6cc40","permalink":"https://www.tjlongspanbridge.com/publication/2020ijss1/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020ijss1/","section":"publication","summary":"In recent years, many long-span suspension bridges have been constructed and the shape finding is a key issue in the design stage. This paper presents an improved shape-finding method which can overcome the shortcomings of the previous shape-finding method. The improved method is based on the common finite element analysis and convenient to be widely used in normal engineering practice. The main step can be summarized as follows. First, the vertical force components of the hangers are determined according to the construction method. Second, in the midspan, the initial equilibrium state of the main cable is calculated iteratively based on the Newton–Raphson method. Third, in the side span, the shape finding for the main cable is executed according to the horizontal force equilibrium of the pylon. Finally, the full-bridge model is obtained and examined carefully. The improved method is demonstrated through one suspension bridge with a planar cable system and one with a spatial cable system. The results show that the improved method is more efficient and accurate compared with the previous shape-finding method.","tags":[],"title":"Paper Published: Improved Method for Shape Finding of Long‑Span Suspension Bridges","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Academic  Academic | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click  PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?

Firstly, the project established the tension and compression constitutive models of UHPC through material performance tests, and then carried out shear tests on 25 large-sized UHPC rectangular beams, mainly focusing on the internal stress characteristics, crack development, failure mode, ultimate deflection, and ultimate bearing capacity of UHPC beams. By controlling eight key factors including shear-span ratio, stirrup ratio, pre-stress force, longitudinal reinforcement ratio, UHPC tensile strength, and steel fiber content, type, and size, the impact of these factors on the shear performance of UHPC beams was studied.\nSecondly, a refined numerical simulation analysis method for the shear process of UHPC rectangular beams was established, which used the concrete plastic damage model (CDP) to calculate the damage changes in the numerical beam tension and compression, and used the extended finite element method (XFEM) to calculate the generation and development of cracks in the numerical beam. The numerical model can simulate the development of the main crack and the distribution of diffuse cracks in UHPC beams, fully considering the effects of steel fibers and prestressed steel bars, and is in good agreement with experimental phenomena and main data.\nFurthermore, the shear bearing capacity calculation methods of UHPC-related standards and the shear bearing capacity calculation methods based on the ultimate equilibrium method were analyzed and compared, and the calculation assumptions, models, and shear contribution factors were compared. It was concluded that the ultimate equilibrium method considers all factors and has good calculation accuracy.\nFinally, a set of UHPC beam shear bearing capacity calculation formula was established, which can comprehensively consider the shear contribution of each part of the UHPC beam, fully consider the impact of steel fibers and has certain redundancy, and the calculation results are in good agreement with the experimental data, literature and related test data.
