From the Corbel arch over 4000 years ago to the stone arch bridge of the Mycenaean Civilization, from the ancient arch bridge of the Rome period to the Bayonne Bridge, the brilliance of the arch bridge in the past is shown. Then, from several points of view, including the development of bridge span and application of new material, the structural system and key structural member, the construction method, the calculation theory and analysis method, the innovation of the arch bridge after World War II is presented. It is revealed that only innovation can help to achieve longer spans and diverse structural forms of arch bridges. Possible directions for the future development of arch bridges are discussed in the last part.\n","date":1679356800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1679356800,"objectID":"8576a49f2b9824508d7d70ff887dfde6","permalink":"https://tjlongspanbridge.com/post/news_xiaoconference_archbridge/","publishdate":"2023-03-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/news_xiaoconference_archbridge/","section":"post","summary":"Prof. Xiao was invited to give a keynote speech at the Second World Conference on Long Span Arch Bridge Construction Technology held from March 19 – 21 in Nanning, GuangXi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China.","tags":[],"title":"Prof. Xiao was invited to give a keynote speech","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Academic  Academic | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click  PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?
